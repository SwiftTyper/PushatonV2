# AWS Backend Guide for Endless Runner Game

## Overview
This guide will walk you through setting up a serverless AWS backend for your iOS endless runner game. We'll use various AWS services to create a scalable, reliable backend infrastructure.

## Architecture
For an endless runner game, we'll need the following AWS components:

1. **AWS Cognito** - For player authentication and user management
2. **AWS DynamoDB** - To store player data, high scores, and game state
3. **AWS Lambda** - For serverless functions to handle game logic
4. **AWS API Gateway** - To create RESTful APIs for the game client
5. **AWS CloudFront** - For content delivery (assets, leaderboards)

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Player Authentication (AWS Cognito)
- Set up a Cognito User Pool for player registration and authentication
- Configure OAuth flows for social login (optional)
- Implement secure token handling in the iOS client

### 2. Game Data Storage (DynamoDB)
Tables needed:
- Players (player_id, username, stats)
- Scores (player_id, score, timestamp)
- GameState (player_id, current_progress, powerups)

### 3. Game Logic (Lambda Functions)
Create Lambda functions for:
- Player registration/login
- Score submission and validation
- Leaderboard updates
- Game state synchronization

### 4. API Endpoints (API Gateway)
Create RESTful endpoints for:
- /auth - Authentication endpoints
- /scores - Score submission and retrieval
- /players - Player profile management
- /state - Game state management

### 5. Client Integration
Steps to integrate with iOS client:
1. Implement AWS SDK
2. Handle authentication flow
3. Set up API calls for game data
4. Implement real-time updates

## Security Considerations
- Use AWS IAM roles and policies
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate all input data
- Secure sensitive player information

## Scaling Considerations
- Use DynamoDB auto-scaling
- Implement caching for leaderboards
- Configure CloudFront for asset delivery
- Set up CloudWatch monitoring

## Next Steps
1. Set up your AWS account
2. Follow the AWS SAM/CDK deployment guide
3. Implement basic authentication flow
4. Create data models
5. Test API endpoints
6. Integrate with iOS client
